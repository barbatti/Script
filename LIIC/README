LIIC
Mario Barbatti, Jul 2006.

LIIC program makes linear interpolation of internal
coordinates and return the cartesian geometries.

liic.pl - main driver
liic2.pl - alternative program
liic.f90 - makes the interpolation
cart2int.f - Columbus program to make the 
coordinate transformation.

The difference between liic and liic2 is the way of 
managing the internal coordinates. liic uses 
the actual set of internal coordinates (geomch = 0 
in cart2int) while liic2 uses the the internal 
coordinates increment (geomch = 1 in cart2int).

For some reason, that i couldn't understand, liic2 works
better than liic.

INPUT:
geom.ini  : initial cartesian geometry, Columbus format
geom.last : final cartesian geometry, Columbus format
intcfl    : internal coordinates definition, Columbus format 

RUN:
liic.pl (liic2.pl) in the directory containing the input files.

The variable COLUMBUS should be defined in the environment.

Known bugs:
The program doesn't run adequately under certain 
Columbus compilations.
